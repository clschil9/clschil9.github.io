        <p>Hey, folks! Christina here. I've been tasked with telling you a bit about myself, so here goes.</p>
        <p>I am (finally!) a college senior at Virginia Tech, working to finish a degree in Creative Writing--though I've been taking a technical editing class on the side. You can never do too much to make yourself more hireable!</p>
        <p>Harry Potter is my go-to "safe" series; if I need something to read that I know I'll love, I read that. I know far more about J.K. Rowling's world than my own, and am still deciding whether or not to change that. In general, though, I love to read fantasy, science fiction, and, occasionally, actual literature (read: Jane Austen).</p>
        <p>I am currently the proud owner of a lovely, sassy, slightly dangerous old cat. She is the reason that I am less likely to get depressed; even though she doesn't cuddle with me (voluntarily), she still loves me! Plus, my parents also have a cat, and our family used to have a dog that my lovely aunt and uncle took in for us when my parents moved to a smaller apartment. I wouldn't be able to handle life without these animals!</p>
